  <h1>Jantsen DeRoest</h1>
  <p><em>Founder and CTO of <strong><a href="www.MetricLytics.agency">MetricLytics</a></strong> in the making.</em></p>
  <p>
    I'm 28 years old, married and have 3 kids. I enjoy doing activities with my family such as hiking, biking, board games, video games, and foosball.
    I've spent a good majority of my time the last few months pursuing certification in Google Analytics and Google Adwords. I'm now certified in both. These two tools in tangent with HTML/CSS and javascript do wonders for digital marketing. I
    developed the website MetricLytics as a dummy site to experiment with various marketing tactics. All said and done, these tools are spectacular for analytical tracking.
    I've currently been studying Javascript, this is a language that I know will take me to the next level in web development, however I do not currently have a working knowledge of it. Instead I wanted to focus on advancing my knowledge in the
    foundation of the web HTML & CSS.
    While working I've found listening to podcasts to be very enjoyable. It's also a great way to stay connected with the latest in web development. One of my favorites related to development is the Shop Talk Show. I've found the approach Christ
    Coyier and Dave Rupert take to resolving problems in development refreshing.
